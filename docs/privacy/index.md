# Privacy Policy — GHL AI Assistant
**Effective date:** 2025-12-23

## Overview
GHL AI Assistant generates suggested replies inside GoHighLevel Conversations pages. To do this, it reads the text of the currently open conversation and sends it to our backend to generate reply suggestions.

## Data we collect
We collect the minimum data needed to operate the extension:

- **Account information:** email address; company name; optional display name.
- **Authentication data:** credentials you enter to sign in (processed for login); session tokens (stored locally in the extension so you stay signed in).
- **User-provided settings:** optional custom instructions you enter; extension settings.
- **Conversation content:** the text shown in the active GoHighLevel conversation and any draft/context needed to generate suggestions.

## How we use data
- Authenticate you and keep you signed in.
- Check subscription status to control access.
- Generate reply suggestions using AI based on the current conversation text and your optional instructions.
- Maintain security and reliability (e.g., preventing abuse, diagnosing errors).

## Sharing / processors
We share data only with service providers required to operate the extension:
- **Appwrite** (authentication and user/subscription data storage).
- **AI model provider** used by our backend to generate reply suggestions.

We do **not** sell user data.

## Payments
Payments are handled by our payment processor. We do not collect or store credit card numbers. We may store subscription status and identifiers needed to validate access.

## Data retention
- Session tokens and saved settings are stored locally in the extension until you sign out or clear extension storage.
- Conversation content is processed to generate suggestions. We do not use conversation content for advertising. Operational logs may temporarily include minimal request metadata needed for reliability and security.

## User choices
- You can sign out to remove the local session token.
- You can edit/clear your custom instructions at any time.
